<p>a.	Have two absolutely positioned DIVs on the page with either content or background colors set to make them visible. Initially one AP DIV will overlap the other. When either AP DIV is double-clicked, they will reverse overlap position (i.e. send the top one back, and bring the back one to the front). Also, make the back AP DIV fade to about 50% of normal brightness. </p>

<p>b.	Simulate your own accordion menu with four header/paragraph combinations. Give the headers an initial background color. Initially only the headers show, but when I click on a header the following paragraph will show and the header will highlight with a new background color. If I click another header or the same header again, the paragraph will hide and the background color will revert. Everything else should slide up and down (reposition) appropriately.</p>

<a href="PartC.html" target="_blank"> Part C </a><br>
<p>c.	Set up three DIVs with different text and images of roughly the same size. Have them hide/display (shuffle) in the same position on the screen every five seconds (i.e. make your own slide show).</p>
